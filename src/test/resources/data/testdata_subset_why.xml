			room. The living room was fine, but the kitchen was a disaster. I
			felt the need to clean the floor and in an effort to do so, I took
			out a mop and mopped up the floor. This took some of the stickiness
			away and made it feel much better. I sprayed cleaner on the floor
			before cleaning it and also did some sweeping. This felt good and I
			was able to clean the floor. After sweeping and mopping the floor, I
			let it sit for a while so that I didn't slip on it. It looked shiny

			unconventional way. Instead of using a roller and painting the walls
			a solid color, she would dab a rag in the pan of paint and repeatedly
			press it against the wall, creating a unique textured look. The
			problem was, her bedroom was huge, so this took months and enlisted
			the help of me and my siblings. The first time I tried it, I did all
			of the dabs in a really uniform way, so each looked like the other.
			This was not how she had painted the rest of the wall, and so my

		<text>The first order of business in feeding a baby is to make sure
			he's hungry, because if he's not hungry, he's not going to eat. In
			our case, it's been a while since the baby last ate, and he's getting
			a little “fussy,” so he's probably hungry. (It's probably time to
			change his diaper, too, but that's another story.) His Mom is at
			work, but she left some milk in a bottle in the refrigerator. So the
			first thing to do is set the baby down in a safe place. We'll put him
			in his monkey chair and strap him in. Then we need to pour some water
			in the bottom of a pot, put the pot on the stove, turn on the heat,
			and put the bottle with the milk in the water at the bottom of the
			pot to heat up the milk. After a bit, we remove the bottle from the
			water and flick a little milk on our wrist to make sure it's warm but
			not too hot. When the milk is just the right temperature, we turn off
			the stove, remove the bottle from the pot, remove the baby from the
			monkey seat and head for the couch. Then we cradle the little tyke,
			show him the bottle, and let him do the rest. When he's finished,
			turn him face down over your shoulder and pat him a few times to let
			him burp if he needs to. Mission accomplished. Go change his diaper.

		<text>Washing clothes is a frequent activity that used to be done by
			hand but now can be done using washing machines and dryers. Some
			people with lots of children wash clothes everyday. To wash clothes
			you need to gather all the dirty clothes and use a laundry machine.
			Some people have laundry machines at home and some people need to go
			to a wash house to use laundry machines. The wash houses have all
			different size machines and some take coins and other wash houses
			take cards. To wash the clothes you have to separate by color so that
			all the white clothes are together and all the colored clothing is
			together. Also if you have sheets and towels you want to wash those
			separately. When you find a machine that is the right size for the
			clothes you need to wash you add the clothes and then follow the
			directions to see how much laundry soap you add. Some people use
			liquid laundry soap and some people use powder laundry soap. You can
			even do a mixture or combination but make sure to use the right
			amount. After adding the clothes and the soap you pay for the machine
			and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the clothes to wash. After the
			clothes are washed you still need to put them in a dryer unless they
			are delicate clothes that are not supposed to go into the dryer
			because they might shrink. You take the clothes and put them in the
			dryer but make sure not to put anything that might shrink. For the
			delicate clothes you hang them to dry. After you put all your clothes
			into the dryers it is time to fold the laundry! This is important so
			the laundry will be nice and neat and not wrinkled. If you have long
			pants or nice shirts you can put them on hangers instead of folding.

		<text>I walked to the bus stop near my home so that I could get to
			work . I brought along my purse which had my bus card in it so that I
			could ride without paying cash . It only took a few minutes for the
			noisy bus to arrive . It stopped at the bus stop and the door opened
			. The bus driver scanned my bus card and I walked to an empty bench
			near the middle of the bus . Many other passengers boarded the bus
			after me and soon the bus was nearly full . Looking around me , I saw
			a number of senior citizens as well as other young adults . There was
			even a woman with a sleeping baby sitting on the bus near my bench .
			I decided to listen to music on my smart phone while I waited for the
			bus to reach my destination . The bus stopped every few minutes to
			let other passengers on and off of the bus . After about an hour ,
			the bus stopped at my bus stop and I got up and walked out of the bus
			, wishing the driver a good day .</text>

		<text>I needed to get to the craft store , there was a sale !

		<text>Last week , my friend and I rode the public bus into town . We
			looked at a bus schedule and found the bus stop closest to our homes
			. We got to the bus stop ten minutes before our bus was supposed to
			arrive and waited . When it arrived , we got into the line to board .
			Each person in front of us climbed the steps and put a token into the
			machine at the front of the bus . We had no token , so we gave the
			bus driver our money and he gave us tokens to put in . We found a
			seat at the back of the bus and sat down . We checked our bus
			schedule and decided where we wanted to get off . When the sign at
			the front of the bus showed that it was our stop , we gathered our
			things and prepared to get off . After we got off , we made a note of
			which bus stop we were at and the time the bus would be there again
			to take us home . Then we went off to explore the town .</text>

		<text>Yesterday I had to go across town to the library to return some
			books . All my friends were busy and my car was in for repairs , so I
			had to take the bus . First thing was to see what bus I needed . I
			went over to my computer and pulled up the bus schedules for my city
			. I found the nearest bus stop and checked the bus lines that stopped
			there , then looked for the stop nearest the library . There was a
			bus that went to both stops , so I would n't have to change buses to
			get there . Next I found the next time the bus would be at the stop
			near my house , which was only 15 minutes from now . I grabbed the
			books and headed out to walk to the bus stop . I got to the stop
			about 5 minutes early and waited for the bus to arrive . It was only
			2 minutes late , which is n't too bad . I climbed into the bus , paid
			the driver and found an empty seat . It was a pretty nice day , so I
			just sat there looking out the window until we got to the stop by the
			library . I got off the bus and went inside to return my books . It
			was a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all .</text>

		<text>Last Saturday , I decided to visit a friend in the hospital . I
			own a car , but it 's been acting up lately , so I needed to take the
			bus . I set out from my apartment with a spring in my step , because
			it was an amazing day . I walked through my apartment complex 's
			parking lot to reach the bus stop , where I waited for the bus around
			5 minutes . When it came to a stop in front of me , I boarded and put
			a $ 1 bill and 2 quarters in the fare machine . I selected a seat
			near the entrance , because it has more space and fewer people .
			Riding the bus often gives me motion sickness , so I closed my eyes
			and tried to ignore the swaying motion as it rolled down the street .
			Behind me , two college students were eagerly discussing a class
			project . In the very back , a small child was loudly pretending to
			be a dinosaur . I was glad when I finally reached my destination . I
			pulled the cord signaling that I would need the bus to stop next to
			the hospital , and got up to exit out the bus 's side door . Fresh
			air never smelled so good !</text>

		<text>My car was in the shop , so today I decided to commute to school

		<text>Last Friday , my car broke down . I had to get to work Monday ,

			finally pulled up . I let others at the stop get on first , then I
			got on . I asked the bus driver how much the fare was and he told me
			. I paid the fare by sticking my money in the box near the bus driver
			, and walked to find a free seat . I found one near the back of the

			I noted that the ride went the same route that I did . Once the bus
