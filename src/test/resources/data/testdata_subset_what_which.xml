		<text>My cat Max lets me know when he's hungry. He meows pitifully,
			like his heart is broken. Then he walks back and forth in front of me
			as I prepare his food, snapping his tail. That's so I don't forget
			him, I guess. I always wash his bowl first. Then I dry it, and pour
			in a scoop of kibble. I put a chunk of canned cat food on top of
			that, less than a quarter of a flat can. Next, I put the bowl on the
			floor and stand back. He runs to the bowl and starts eating as fast
			as he can. He eats all the soft food on the top as fast as lightning.
			Then he takes his time with the kibble, eating more and more slowly
			until its gone. When he finally finishes he slinks away. Then I wipe
			up the floor, because Max is not a tidy eater.</text>

			more runny eggs left, I turned off the stove and spread my mixed
			veggies on one side of the omelette. Then I used my spatula to fold
			the omelette in half so that the mixed veggies were in between the
			sides of the omelette, kind of like a sandwich. I put my omelette on

			boyfriend ordered the steak. However, as soon as our server brought
			the food, I could see that something was wrong. Instead of a rack of

			before I add the eggs though because I don't want them to stick. I
			let the pan sit for a bit so the egg mixture heats up a bit on one
			side. As this occurs, I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of

			to the wrapping paper. I then opened the wrapping paper, and pulled
			out enough paper to cover the entire gift. I used a pair of scissors
			to cut the paper at that length. I then put the paper on the floor,

	<instance id="243" scenario="washing clothes">
		<text>Washing clothes is a frequent activity that used to be done by
			hand but now can be done using washing machines and dryers. Some
			people with lots of children wash clothes everyday. To wash clothes
			you need to gather all the dirty clothes and use a laundry machine.
			Some people have laundry machines at home and some people need to go
			to a wash house to use laundry machines. The wash houses have all
			different size machines and some take coins and other wash houses
			take cards. To wash the clothes you have to separate by color so that
			all the white clothes are together and all the colored clothing is
			together. Also if you have sheets and towels you want to wash those
			separately. When you find a machine that is the right size for the
			clothes you need to wash you add the clothes and then follow the
			directions to see how much laundry soap you add. Some people use
			liquid laundry soap and some people use powder laundry soap. You can
			even do a mixture or combination but make sure to use the right
			amount. After adding the clothes and the soap you pay for the machine
			and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the clothes to wash. After the
			clothes are washed you still need to put them in a dryer unless they
			are delicate clothes that are not supposed to go into the dryer
			because they might shrink. You take the clothes and put them in the
			dryer but make sure not to put anything that might shrink. For the
			delicate clothes you hang them to dry. After you put all your clothes
			into the dryers it is time to fold the laundry! This is important so
			the laundry will be nice and neat and not wrinkled. If you have long
			pants or nice shirts you can put them on hangers instead of folding.

			neither of us had seen a movie in a long time. As a result, I found a

			that would be enjoyable to both of us, since that was the type of
			movie that we wanted to watch. Once I found the movie, I put it into
			the DVD player and started to watch. We both relaxed and watching the
			movie. Later, I had to turn the volume up because we were having

			I had to set the sleep timer on the TV so that it would not remain on
			all night. However, we did end up staying awake throughout the

		<text>It is late at night and the sun has gone down, and my kid is
			sleepy. It is bed time. He is still very little though and needs some
			help going to bed. I take him to his room and make sure he gets ready
			before going to sleep. He brushes his teeth and washes his face so he
			stays clean and healthy every day. Once he is done, he changes into
			clothes for sleeping so that his other clothes stay clean while he
			sleeps. He crawls into bed and I pull the covers over him. His head
			rests on his pillow so he is comfortable and can fall asleep better.
			He is afraid of the dark like me, so I leave a nightlight on for him
			in the hallway. A little light at night can help you feel better and
			more relaxed, but too much light keeps you awake. I tuck him in and
			say goodnight and let him fall asleep.</text>

		<text>Emily had fallen asleep on the sofa after supper while we were
			all watching the new movie Dad had rented. The movie had been boring,
			and Emily had fallen quickly asleep. Mom asked me to try to wake her
			when the movie was over, but she just snored louder every time I
			tried to shake her awake. She was such a deep sleeper. Dad sometimes
			joked that she could sleep through a brass band marching through her
			room. I believed it now. I had tried very hard to wake her up. I went
			in and told my mom I couldn't get her up. Mom smiled and hugged me,
			told me good night, and patted my head. I went into the living room
			to watch as she kissed Emily on the forehead. She gently slid her
			arms under Emily's sleeping body, and lifted her up to chest level. I
			followed her up the stairs and to the room me and Emily shared. Mom
			pulled the covers down on Emily's bed, and I pulled mine down. Emily
			woke up just enough to climb down from Mom and snuggle under the
			covers. Mom kissed us both once more and turned out the light.</text>

		<text>It was night time and it was time to go to bed. The boy wanted

			tub and spilt water all over the floor. Next he dried off in a big,
			fluffy blue towel. Then he brushed his teeth with his special Star
			Wars toothbrush. Next he dressed in his Star Wars underwear and then
			put on his Star Wars pajamas. His dad and I tucked him into his bed
			that was made with Star Wars sheets. He said his prayers. Next was
			story time. I pulled out his favorite book about (you guessed it)
			Star Wars. He gradually dozed off dreaming about Anakin Skywalker and
			a galaxy far, far away.</text>

		<text>Yesterday my car broke down , so I was thinking of how I would
			get to work . I decided one of the best options would be to take a
			public bus . Since I 've never taken one before , I went to the city
			website and looked at a schedule of all the bus times and routes .
			When I had finally decided on the bus that I needed to take , it was
			time to put my plan into action . I left my house and walked over to
			the bus stop . There were a few other people waiting there as well .
			When the bus arrived I got on and paid the driver the fee , which was
			$ 1 . I then sat down and waited for the bus to arrive at my
			destination . It took about 40 minutes to get where I was going , and
			I arrived safely . I think that overall it was a pleasant experience

		<text>I live near the city of Santa Cruz and often take the 17X bus to
			the nearby city of San Jose . It 's possible to get discount fares by
			paying for multiple rides in advance , but I usually pay cash , five
			dollars for one-way . I get to my small town 's transit center early
			on weekday mornings , because the bus fills up quickly , and most
			good seats are already taken by riders who started their trip in
			downtown Santa Cruz . We wait in line in civilized fashion . Some
			people need only show the driver their pass , some shove a
			five-dollar bill into the fare machine efficiently . But some fumble
			with small coins or ask other riders for change , which makes
			everyone in line restive . Once on , riders can choose seats grouped
			around small tables , seats facing forward , or seats facing sideways
			. Table seats are premium , since the bus has WiFi and many people
			bring laptops . Others prefer seats in the back where the roughnecks
			are , just like in high school . My little town is the last stop
			before highway 17 . The bus whips along amid the pine trees and the
			yellow-flowered acacia that blooms this time of year . It is pleasant
			not to have to keep your eyes on the road . Unspoken bus etiquette
			decrees that strangers do n't speak to each other , but of course
			some people know each other and chat . Many tap away on their
			machines or play video games , others read books or enjoy the ride .
			It ends at San Jose 's train station , where passengers can transfer
			to the San Francisco train , or take a rattling inferior 1-hour bus
			ride to Fremont to catch the BART mass transit line to Oakland ,
			Richmond , or distant Pittsburg , where the California Delta begins .
