			landing on my driveway. I sat up and wrapped my pink robe around me.
			I slipped my feet into my slippers and looked at the clock. It was
			only 7:00 but it was time for me to get my newspaper and drink some
			coffee. I looked out the window and noticed it was raining quite a
			bit. I saw the newspaper at the end of my driveway, as far away as it
			could be. I grabbed my umbrella out of my coat closet and opened my
			front door enough to stick the umbrella through and open it outside.
			I stepped out the door and quickly covered my head with the umbrella.
			Then I ran to the end of my driveway, scooped up the newspaper in its
			plastic wrapping, and ran back to my front door. I closed my
			umbrella, took off my slippers, and dried off. Then, I unwrapped my
			newspaper and sat down to read it.</text>

			tree were firmly connected with the soil . When I was sure the tree
			was firmly in the ground and would not move , I got my garden hose .

			mixed very well, but did not overdo. I turned on my stove, put the
			nonstick pan on and turned stove on medium heat. Meanwhile I got some
			cheese and salsa out for extra flavor. When the pan was hot enough, I
			added 2 tablespoon of unsalted butter( I love butter), and then I did
			not wait it to be hot, but immediately poured my eggs into pan. The
			pan was already hot, so I started to bubble and cook. In a minute, I
			started to stir my eggs, added some cheese and salsa, salt and some
			pepper. I stirred the eggs till they became fluffy and cooked. When
			all moisture disappeared, I moved pan from stove, transferred it to
			plate.</text>

		<text>First we travel to the tennis court. Next we change into our
			sports clothes, and put on our tennis shoes. Then we grab our
			equipment and some balls from the supply. We begin to play the match.
			Tennis involves hitting a ball with something called a "tennis
			racket". This racket allows you to swing and hit a ball over a net.
			The goal is to avoid hitting the net, and hit the ball so that it is
			difficult for your opponent to hit the ball back to you. However, if
			your opponent hits the ball, he must also make sure the ball doesn't
			touch the net. Both of you may hit the ball off the ground,
			reflecting it into the air yet you must avoid the net. If your
			opponent hits the next or makes the ball go out of bounds, then you
			score a point. The objective is to make your opponent hit the net as
			many times as you can.</text>

			a solid color, she would dab a rag in the pan of paint and repeatedly
			press it against the wall, creating a unique textured look. The
			problem was, her bedroom was huge, so this took months and enlisted

		<text>It is morning and I just woke up. I am very sleepy and think
			that some coffee will wake me up. Coffee has caffeine in it, which is
			good at waking people up and giving them energy. Too much caffeine is
			bad though and can make you feel nervous. I make sure to only drink
			coffee every now and then to stay healthy. Coffee is made from
			pouring hot water on coffee beans, and a coffee maker does this for
			you. I make sure that the coffee maker has enough water in it, and
			put coffee beans that have been smashed up into the top. The coffee
			is easier to make when the beans are smashed up, so people normally
			smash the beans into grounds. I turn the coffee maker on, and it
			heats up the water and pours it into the coffee grounds. The water
			passes through the machine and falls out as coffee into a cup I put
			at the bottom. My coffee is hot and ready, and smells good.</text>

			water out of the bucket onto the stones to get the steam flowing; we
			let the heat wash over us, open up our pores and seep into our
			muscles. It was fun sitting with my friends enjoying the steam, I
			even stretched out on the bench and it made the whole experience even
			better. After an hour of soaking up the hot vapors we decided it was

		<text>In our house, we have a guest room that must not have been
			touched since the 1970's. It is carpeted in tasteless, dirty and old
			carpet that is begging to be changed. After considering several
			options, my wife and I decided to rip the carpet up and install some
			wood laminate flooring. We picked a day on the weekend and invited
			her father over to help us with the process. First we ripped the old
			carpeting up and prepared the bare surface to accept the new
			flooring. We had the flooring ordered and delivered the day
			previously, so I spent that night measuring and cutting the pieces to
			size. After the floor was properly prepped, we began laying each
			piece of laminate one by one. A few spots did not fit quite as
			planned so it became necessary to cut some pieces shorter than I had
			initially. Once we finished we took a long break and ordered pizza
			for dinner.</text>

		<text>I fell down on my driveway this morning and scraped my knee. It

			it would not get infected. Therefore, I applied the antibiotic

			it often. One time stands out more than the others, though. I have
			collected exactly $3.15. This was enough for a snickers bar, two bags
			of Doritos, and a pack of jolly ranchers. This was all in quarters,
			nickles, and dimes. When I got to the machine, after I bought my
			food, a woman came up to the machine and tried to buy a Kit-Kat. I
			didn't know her well, but the machine failed. The Kit-Kat was left
			hanging on the edge, almost off. I didn't have any more money, or I
			would have helped her by purchasing a Kit-Kat myself. instead, we
			pounded on the glass and pushed at the machine. I didn't want to risk
			rocking it because it was very heavy and would be lethal if it fell.
			So, we just stood there frustrated, until someone else I didn't know
			came up and asked about our predicament. I didn't know this fellow,
			either. He just hit it once it exactly the right spot, and the candy
			bar fell down. So she got what she ordered, and we were all happy.

		<text>Last Tuesday was another typical workday. Following my daily

			up from my desk with a smile on my face and started to make my way
			down the hall. It was the perfect time for an afternoon snack. What
			would I want? There were so many options. I could opt for something
			healthy, maybe a granola or a kind bar. Or maybe, perhaps, it was the
			perfect time to indulge in some chocolate. On the other hand, I could
			always play it safe and get some popcorn or even some potato chips. I

			paying full attention to the grumbles of my stomach. Finally, I came
			to E6 - the double twix bar. I felt my hunger pang immediately.
			Ladies and gentleman, we have a winner. I dug into my pocked and
			pulled out four quarters, and hastily jammed them into the machine.
			The twix fell down and not wasting any time I grabbed for it, ready
			to take a bite and get on with my day.</text>

		<text>In the town I used to live in, there usually wasn't much to do
			as far as activities go. However, when the local bowling alley opened
			up, that instantly became a popular spot to hang out. It had just
			about everything from arcade games to bowling to a bar, and they
			served great food. A usual visit to the bowling alley involved me and
			either a group of friends or family. We would start things off with
			an actual game of bowling. We would go over to the counter to check
			in and get our bowling shoes, followed by getting our lane. While one
			person set up the game of bowling, the rest of us would go and get
			the right sized bowling ball that we wanted. When everything was all
			set, we'd proceed with our game. I usually always came in last, since
			I'm not very good at bowling. After the game of bowling, we'd go off
			ad play arcade games and laser tag.</text>

			was shown how to put my fingers in the holes of the bowling ball.
			Then I stood behind the foul line which is a piece of colored tape or

		<text>Yesterday I went bowling with my friends. They told me that they
			would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm. At 2pm I started getting
			ready. By 2:30pm I was ready. I made sure to bring socks with me,
			since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley. I
			grabbed my car keys and got in my car. I drove to the bowling alley.
			I listened to a little bit of music on my way. Once I got to the
			bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside. Once I was
			inside, I walked over to my friends. I asked them how many games they
			wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games. I
			walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.
			The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50. I wanted two play
			two games with my friends so I paid $7.00. Next, I needed to buy
			shoes so that I could bowl. I needed special shoes to go bowling so
			that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl. I asked the
			cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a
			pair. Now I needed a bowling ball. But I didn't want a bowling ball
			that would be too heavy. So I chose one that was only five pounds.
			All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling. We all
			put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game. I
			was first. Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes,
			and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting. Then I took my
			bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back
			then I let go of the bowl. The bowling ball flew down the lane. Out
			of the ten pins I knocked down six. Since I didn't knock down all of
			the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's
			turn to bowl. I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.
			Since I knocked down all of the pins I got a spare! By the end of the
			game I had won the most points out of all of my friends! I won! I
			returned my bowling shoes and then we all left to go eat dinner!

		<text>It is late at night and the sun has gone down, and my kid is

			before going to sleep. He brushes his teeth and washes his face so he
			stays clean and healthy every day. Once he is done, he changes into
			clothes for sleeping so that his other clothes stay clean while he
			sleeps. He crawls into bed and I pull the covers over him. His head
			rests on his pillow so he is comfortable and can fall asleep better.
			He is afraid of the dark like me, so I leave a nightlight on for him
			in the hallway. A little light at night can help you feel better and
			more relaxed, but too much light keeps you awake. I tuck him in and
			say goodnight and let him fall asleep.</text>

		<text>Emily had fallen asleep on the sofa after supper while we were
			all watching the new movie Dad had rented. The movie had been boring,

			when the movie was over, but she just snored louder every time I
			tried to shake her awake. She was such a deep sleeper. Dad sometimes
			joked that she could sleep through a brass band marching through her
			room. I believed it now. I had tried very hard to wake her up. I went
			in and told my mom I couldn't get her up. Mom smiled and hugged me,
			told me good night, and patted my head. I went into the living room
			to watch as she kissed Emily on the forehead. She gently slid her

			pulled the covers down on Emily's bed, and I pulled mine down. Emily
			woke up just enough to climb down from Mom and snuggle under the

		<text>I ride the bus to school everyday . I live in New York City so
			riding the bus is a common thing . Everyone does it because it is
			convenient . In our city , it is very packed , so driving is n't as
			convenient or affordable . Parking is expensive so public
			transportation saves us a lot of money . Every morning when I go to
			school , I wait by the bus stop . The morning bus comes every ten
			minutes . Once it arrives I board onto the bus and I insert my metro
			card . The metro card has a balance of money stored inside it . This
			money is subtracted from the balance every time I ride the bus and
			insert my metro card . Basically the metro card pays for the bus ride
			. When I run out of money , I go to a metro card machine and put more
			money into my balance . Riding the bus is annoying sometimes . In the
			morning , it is very crowded so sometimes there are n't enough seats
			for everybody . This means I have to stand while holding on to a pole
			. Sometimes its so crowded that I am sandwiched in between people .
			If I am lucky , sometimes there will be open seats . Otherwise , I

		<text>'' `` Riding A Public Bus '' '' Hannah and her mommy had just
			moved to the city . Daddy took the car to work each day now and her
			and mommy decided they wanted to go to the shopping center . Hannah
			was excited because today was her first time taking the public bus .
			Hannah and her family had moved to Portland , Maine and the bus they
			were taking was called the Metro . Hannah took her mom 's hand as
			they walked down the sunny streets of the city until they reached a
			sign that Hannah could not read but she did understand the picture .
			It was a picture of a bus . '' `` Does that sign say bus mommy ? ''
			'' Hannah asked . Her mother replied that it was and it was one of
			many many places around the city to get the bus to stop for them and
			others . They waited for a long while and finally a large public bus
			came down the street and stopped before them . They waited while a
			few passengers exited the bus because her mom said it was the polite
			thing to do and then they climbed the steps where her mother dropped
			their coins into the busses toll collector . Her mother then asked
			for a transfer and they walked quickly to their seats . Hannah asked
			her mom what a transfer was and she explained that because they were
			going way across the city they would need to get on yet another bus
			and the transfer was so the other bus driver could see they already
			paid for their ride . Soon the bus jolted to another stop an older
			lady stepped onto the bus and flashed a card at the bus driver and
			took a seat at the front of the bus that was saved for elderly and
			handicapped people . Hannah tugged at her moms sleeve and whispered
			the lady did not pay . Her mother quietly told her she had a bus pass
			that she paid for a whole months worth of rides for a bigger fee than
			just one ride . That people who use the bus daily buy them to save
			money . Hannah thought to herself she would like bus passes for her
			and mommy . She enjoyed the bumpy ride with the jolting stops and
			wide turns that made her have to hold on tight . Hannah also noticed
			people pulling a cord and she figured out why . It made the bus
			driver stop where ever they would like to get off . Oh how she wanted
			to pull the string but , mommy told her no . It was only for when you
			needed it . Soon the bus stopped at the busy bus station . They
			stepped off the bus and got on a new bus . Her mom handed the bus
			driver their transfers . Hannah was excited because this meant the
			next place they were going was the shopping center to buy her new
			shoes . Soon the bus took off and made stop after stop . They even
			picked up a man in a wheelchair . He drove his wheelchair right up a
			special ramp and into a spot on the bus where the driver buckled him
			and his wheelchair in . Soon Hannah 's mom told her she could pull
			the cord to make the bus stop . The cord was up high but with a
			little help from her mom she reached it . Ding ! The bus came to a
			stop shortly after and there was the shopping center right in front
			of them . Taking the bus was a fun form of transportation . Hannah
			waved to the driver as he pulled away to pick up and drop off even
			more people around the city .</text>

		<text>I live near the city of Santa Cruz and often take the 17X bus to
			the nearby city of San Jose . It 's possible to get discount fares by
			paying for multiple rides in advance , but I usually pay cash , five
			dollars for one-way . I get to my small town 's transit center early
			on weekday mornings , because the bus fills up quickly , and most
			good seats are already taken by riders who started their trip in
			downtown Santa Cruz . We wait in line in civilized fashion . Some
			people need only show the driver their pass , some shove a
			five-dollar bill into the fare machine efficiently . But some fumble
			with small coins or ask other riders for change , which makes
			everyone in line restive . Once on , riders can choose seats grouped
			around small tables , seats facing forward , or seats facing sideways
			. Table seats are premium , since the bus has WiFi and many people
			bring laptops . Others prefer seats in the back where the roughnecks
			are , just like in high school . My little town is the last stop
			before highway 17 . The bus whips along amid the pine trees and the
			yellow-flowered acacia that blooms this time of year . It is pleasant
			not to have to keep your eyes on the road . Unspoken bus etiquette
			decrees that strangers do n't speak to each other , but of course
			some people know each other and chat . Many tap away on their
			machines or play video games , others read books or enjoy the ride .
			It ends at San Jose 's train station , where passengers can transfer
			to the San Francisco train , or take a rattling inferior 1-hour bus
			ride to Fremont to catch the BART mass transit line to Oakland ,
			Richmond , or distant Pittsburg , where the California Delta begins .
