			go get the plates. Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa all get big plates,
			but Tom is still little, so he gets a small plastic plate. We set a
			plate on each placemat. Now we need a napkin for each place. Luckily,
			we still have some napkins left over from the birthday party last
			week, so we will use those. It doesn't matter that they say "Happy
			Birthday." We put a folded napkin to the left side of each plate. On
			top of each napkin we put a fork. Except for Tom, he gets a small
			fork. On the right side of the plate we put a knife and spoon. We
			need to be careful with the knives. Closer to the center of the table
			we put a glass by each plate. Tom gets a plastic glass, because he
			isn't ready for a real glass one yet. We are ready to eat!</text>

			and most of my friends hung out in both the kitchen and the living
			room. The living room was fine, but the kitchen was a disaster. I
			felt the need to clean the floor and in an effort to do so, I took
			out a mop and mopped up the floor. This took some of the stickiness
			away and made it feel much better. I sprayed cleaner on the floor
			before cleaning it and also did some sweeping. This felt good and I
			was able to clean the floor. After sweeping and mopping the floor, I
			let it sit for a while so that I didn't slip on it. It looked shiny
			and I felt like my house was much cleaner than when my friends came

		<text>When I was young, my mom had an obsession with painting the
			walls of our house. As soon as she finished painting one room, she
			would start on another. We were in this never ending flux of wall
			colors. Her most ambitious project was painting her bedroom in an
			unconventional way. Instead of using a roller and painting the walls
			a solid color, she would dab a rag in the pan of paint and repeatedly
			press it against the wall, creating a unique textured look. The
			problem was, her bedroom was huge, so this took months and enlisted
			the help of me and my siblings. The first time I tried it, I did all
			of the dabs in a really uniform way, so each looked like the other.
			This was not how she had painted the rest of the wall, and so my
			section stood out and looked very different from the rest. She didn't
			paint over it or anything, so for the remainder of the time that we
			spent in that house, that section of wall looked completely wrong and

			he's hungry, because if he's not hungry, he's not going to eat. In
			our case, it's been a while since the baby last ate, and he's getting
			a little “fussy,” so he's probably hungry. (It's probably time to
			change his diaper, too, but that's another story.) His Mom is at
			work, but she left some milk in a bottle in the refrigerator. So the
			first thing to do is set the baby down in a safe place. We'll put him
			in his monkey chair and strap him in. Then we need to pour some water
			in the bottom of a pot, put the pot on the stove, turn on the heat,
			and put the bottle with the milk in the water at the bottom of the
			pot to heat up the milk. After a bit, we remove the bottle from the
			water and flick a little milk on our wrist to make sure it's warm but
			not too hot. When the milk is just the right temperature, we turn off
			the stove, remove the bottle from the pot, remove the baby from the
			monkey seat and head for the couch. Then we cradle the little tyke,
			show him the bottle, and let him do the rest. When he's finished,
			turn him face down over your shoulder and pat him a few times to let
			him burp if he needs to. Mission accomplished. Go change his diaper.

		<text>Washing clothes is a frequent activity that used to be done by

			people with lots of children wash clothes everyday. To wash clothes
			you need to gather all the dirty clothes and use a laundry machine.
			Some people have laundry machines at home and some people need to go
			to a wash house to use laundry machines. The wash houses have all
			different size machines and some take coins and other wash houses
			take cards. To wash the clothes you have to separate by color so that
			all the white clothes are together and all the colored clothing is
			together. Also if you have sheets and towels you want to wash those
			separately. When you find a machine that is the right size for the
			clothes you need to wash you add the clothes and then follow the
			directions to see how much laundry soap you add. Some people use
			liquid laundry soap and some people use powder laundry soap. You can
			even do a mixture or combination but make sure to use the right
			amount. After adding the clothes and the soap you pay for the machine
			and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the clothes to wash. After the
			clothes are washed you still need to put them in a dryer unless they
			are delicate clothes that are not supposed to go into the dryer
			because they might shrink. You take the clothes and put them in the
			dryer but make sure not to put anything that might shrink. For the
			delicate clothes you hang them to dry. After you put all your clothes
			into the dryers it is time to fold the laundry! This is important so
			the laundry will be nice and neat and not wrinkled. If you have long
			pants or nice shirts you can put them on hangers instead of folding.

		<text>I have a problem with picking scabs off of my skin. One of the
			only ways I can combat this is to apply a band aid over the areas to
			prevent myself from picking at them. To put on the band aid, I open
			the wrapper and then take off the two little pieces of glossy paper
			protecting the sticky adhesive side. I then place the band aid over
			the spot that I either picked already or want to prevent myself from
			picking. Once i do that, I throw away all the band aid remnants. The
			band aid itself is a peach, off-white sort of color -- I hesitate to
			say "nude" because that implies that everyone has the same skin tone,
			which is untrue. I usually leave the band aid on for as long as
			possible, which typically ends up being until I shower next.
			Sometimes I will use small circle band aids if I do not have a full
			band aid available.</text>

		<text>My friends and I decide to go bowling this Friday. We decide to
			call ahead to the bowling alley nearby to reserve our lane at 8 PM on
			Friday. At Friday 8 PM, we all meet up at the bowling alley and we
			check in with the worker. He charges us an admission and shoe rental
			fee. After changing into our new shoes, we head to our lane. The
			first round took us about 40 minutes to complete. After getting the
			hang of everything, we complete the second round in only 20 minutes.
			Everything took us about an hour to complete. At about 9 PM, we
			decide to leave so we return our shoes and proceed to leave. After
			saying our goodbye's we go our separate ways. On the way home, I
			decide that I had a good time bowling so I remind myself to schedule
			another event very soon.</text>

		<text>One day I went bowling. Oh what fun bowling was! I threw a 300

			like the styles of the bowling alley. The shoes they give you are so

			so many other people have put their feet into these shoes before. It
			is alright the shoes are fine. There are also a lot of other shoes to
			choose from in the store there. You can pick white ones or red ones,
			and you can even buy new balls there too. Just ask for the service

		<text>Yesterday I went bowling with my friends. They told me that they
			would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm. At 2pm I started getting
			ready. By 2:30pm I was ready. I made sure to bring socks with me,
			since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley. I
			grabbed my car keys and got in my car. I drove to the bowling alley.
			I listened to a little bit of music on my way. Once I got to the
			bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside. Once I was
			inside, I walked over to my friends. I asked them how many games they
			wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games. I
			walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.
			The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50. I wanted two play
			two games with my friends so I paid $7.00. Next, I needed to buy
			shoes so that I could bowl. I needed special shoes to go bowling so
			that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl. I asked the
			cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a
			pair. Now I needed a bowling ball. But I didn't want a bowling ball
			that would be too heavy. So I chose one that was only five pounds.
			All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling. We all
			put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game. I
			was first. Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes,
			and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting. Then I took my
			bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back
			then I let go of the bowl. The bowling ball flew down the lane. Out
			of the ten pins I knocked down six. Since I didn't knock down all of
			the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's
			turn to bowl. I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.
			Since I knocked down all of the pins I got a spare! By the end of the
			game I had won the most points out of all of my friends! I won! I
			returned my bowling shoes and then we all left to go eat dinner!

		<text>Every night, I'll take my son Jimmy to bed. First I take him to
			the bathroom so that he can brush his teeth and wash his face. Then,
			I take his hand and lead him to bed, he usually is yawning by the
			time we get there. I make sure he's in his pajamas and then under the
			covers. I usually read him a story that I let him pick out. The other
			night he picked out "Where the Wild Things Are" which is also his
			favorite book. After the story, I'll kiss him goodnight and turn off
			the light, but usually Jimmy will ask me to turn his nightlight on,
			but not always as sometimes Jimmy likes to look out his window, but
			only when the moon is bright and the sky is not cloudy. I will tell
			him "good night," one last time before I close his door and go to bed
			myself.</text>

			tub and spilt water all over the floor. Next he dried off in a big,
			fluffy blue towel. Then he brushed his teeth with his special Star
			Wars toothbrush. Next he dressed in his Star Wars underwear and then
			put on his Star Wars pajamas. His dad and I tucked him into his bed
			that was made with Star Wars sheets. He said his prayers. Next was

		<text>I ride the bus to school everyday . I live in New York City so
			riding the bus is a common thing . Everyone does it because it is
			convenient . In our city , it is very packed , so driving is n't as
			convenient or affordable . Parking is expensive so public
			transportation saves us a lot of money . Every morning when I go to
			school , I wait by the bus stop . The morning bus comes every ten
			minutes . Once it arrives I board onto the bus and I insert my metro
			card . The metro card has a balance of money stored inside it . This
			money is subtracted from the balance every time I ride the bus and
			insert my metro card . Basically the metro card pays for the bus ride
			. When I run out of money , I go to a metro card machine and put more
			money into my balance . Riding the bus is annoying sometimes . In the
			morning , it is very crowded so sometimes there are n't enough seats
			for everybody . This means I have to stand while holding on to a pole
			. Sometimes its so crowded that I am sandwiched in between people .
			If I am lucky , sometimes there will be open seats . Otherwise , I
			have to stand for 40 minutes .</text>

		<text>I live near the city of Santa Cruz and often take the 17X bus to

			good seats are already taken by riders who started their trip in

			people need only show the driver their pass , some shove a
			five-dollar bill into the fare machine efficiently . But some fumble
			with small coins or ask other riders for change , which makes
			everyone in line restive . Once on , riders can choose seats grouped
			around small tables , seats facing forward , or seats facing sideways
			. Table seats are premium , since the bus has WiFi and many people
			bring laptops . Others prefer seats in the back where the roughnecks
			are , just like in high school . My little town is the last stop
			before highway 17 . The bus whips along amid the pine trees and the
			yellow-flowered acacia that blooms this time of year . It is pleasant
			not to have to keep your eyes on the road . Unspoken bus etiquette
			decrees that strangers do n't speak to each other , but of course
			some people know each other and chat . Many tap away on their
