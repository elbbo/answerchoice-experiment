			first I thought it was an earthquake! I jumped out of bed and ran to
			the kitchen. I knew that I was going to need something that would
			fill my empty stomach up, so I decided to make an omelette. I opened
			the fridge and grabbed a carton of eggs and some mixed vegetables I
			chopped up last night. Then I opened the cabinet to get a bowl to mix
			my eggs in. I scrambled the eggs up with a fork, and then got a pan
			to put on the stove to cook the eggs in. After I turned on the stove,
			I put some a little bit of oil in the pan so the eggs wouldn't stick.
			I hate when that happens, it always makes cleaning up after really
			hard! Then I poured the eggs from the bowl into the pan and waited
			for the eggs to start to firm up. I poked at them with a spatula,
			pushing parts from the edge of the pan that were kinda firm slowly
			towards the middle of the pan. The uncooked runny eggs slide over to
			where the firm eggs were and cook up really quick! When there was no
			more runny eggs left, I turned off the stove and spread my mixed
			veggies on one side of the omelette. Then I used my spatula to fold
			the omelette in half so that the mixed veggies were in between the
			sides of the omelette, kind of like a sandwich. I put my omelette on
			a plate and took it over to my table to sit down and eat. My stomach
			roared like a lion when I looked down at the omelette. I think it

	<instance id="243" scenario="washing clothes">
		<text>Washing clothes is a frequent activity that used to be done by
			hand but now can be done using washing machines and dryers. Some
			people with lots of children wash clothes everyday. To wash clothes
			you need to gather all the dirty clothes and use a laundry machine.
			Some people have laundry machines at home and some people need to go
			to a wash house to use laundry machines. The wash houses have all
			different size machines and some take coins and other wash houses
			take cards. To wash the clothes you have to separate by color so that
			all the white clothes are together and all the colored clothing is
			together. Also if you have sheets and towels you want to wash those
			separately. When you find a machine that is the right size for the
			clothes you need to wash you add the clothes and then follow the
			directions to see how much laundry soap you add. Some people use
			liquid laundry soap and some people use powder laundry soap. You can
			even do a mixture or combination but make sure to use the right
			amount. After adding the clothes and the soap you pay for the machine
			and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the clothes to wash. After the
			clothes are washed you still need to put them in a dryer unless they
			are delicate clothes that are not supposed to go into the dryer
			because they might shrink. You take the clothes and put them in the
			dryer but make sure not to put anything that might shrink. For the
			delicate clothes you hang them to dry. After you put all your clothes
			into the dryers it is time to fold the laundry! This is important so
			the laundry will be nice and neat and not wrinkled. If you have long
			pants or nice shirts you can put them on hangers instead of folding.

			high heat. I also put a dash of salt into the water, since this is
			supposed to help it boil more quickly. While this heated, I grabbed a
			box of dry pasta and measured out the amount that I wanted into
			another container. I poured the pasta into the water once it was
			boiling. I allowed the pasta to boil for 8 minutes, according to the
			directions of the pasta box. I set a timer to prevent overcooking.
			One the timer went off, I stopped it, turned off the burner, and put
			on oven mitts. I also placed a colander into the sink. While wearing
			the oven mitts, I poured the pasta and water into the colander. I
			then removed the colander from the sink and placed the pasta into a
			bowl so that it was ready to have sauce added to it.</text>

		<text>Yesterday I went bowling with my friends. They told me that they

			since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley. I
			grabbed my car keys and got in my car. I drove to the bowling alley.
			I listened to a little bit of music on my way. Once I got to the
			bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside. Once I was
			inside, I walked over to my friends. I asked them how many games they
			wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games. I
			walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.
			The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50. I wanted two play
			two games with my friends so I paid $7.00. Next, I needed to buy
			shoes so that I could bowl. I needed special shoes to go bowling so
			that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl. I asked the
			cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a
			pair. Now I needed a bowling ball. But I didn't want a bowling ball
			that would be too heavy. So I chose one that was only five pounds.
			All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling. We all
			put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game. I
			was first. Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes,
			and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting. Then I took my
			bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back
			then I let go of the bowl. The bowling ball flew down the lane. Out
			of the ten pins I knocked down six. Since I didn't knock down all of
			the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's
			turn to bowl. I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.
			Since I knocked down all of the pins I got a spare! By the end of the
			game I had won the most points out of all of my friends! I won! I
			returned my bowling shoes and then we all left to go eat dinner!

		<text>I have never had to ride a public bus until 4 years ago when I
			had no other transportation and was forced to take a public bus
			anywhere I needed to go . The first thing I had to do was find a bus
			schedule and learn how to read the time and places to catch the bus
			and how to make any needed transfers . This was a little hard to do
			but once I figured it out it was OK as long as I always kept a
			schedule with me . I mostly took the bus to work and I only had to
			worry about catching one bus on the street I lived on and I did not
			have to sorry about any transfers . The bus ride cost me $ 1.25 and
			transfers where an additional 50 cents . Many people rode the bus and
			I meet several nice people on the bus . The bus drivers were always
			nice and I became friends with several of them . The bus only came
			once an hour and I had to make sure I did not miss it if I was going
			to work because then I would be late for work . The bus always made a
			stop at the main depot in order to pick up more people . There was
			usually about a 20 minute wait so the driver could have break in the
			late afternoon . I did not like having to take the bus but it served
			my purpose for a while and I was thankful to have the bus available .

		<text>'' `` Riding A Public Bus '' '' Hannah and her mommy had just
			moved to the city . Daddy took the car to work each day now and her
			and mommy decided they wanted to go to the shopping center . Hannah
			was excited because today was her first time taking the public bus .
			Hannah and her family had moved to Portland , Maine and the bus they
			were taking was called the Metro . Hannah took her mom 's hand as
			they walked down the sunny streets of the city until they reached a
			sign that Hannah could not read but she did understand the picture .
			It was a picture of a bus . '' `` Does that sign say bus mommy ? ''
			'' Hannah asked . Her mother replied that it was and it was one of
			many many places around the city to get the bus to stop for them and
			others . They waited for a long while and finally a large public bus
			came down the street and stopped before them . They waited while a
			few passengers exited the bus because her mom said it was the polite
			thing to do and then they climbed the steps where her mother dropped
			their coins into the busses toll collector . Her mother then asked
			for a transfer and they walked quickly to their seats . Hannah asked
			her mom what a transfer was and she explained that because they were
			going way across the city they would need to get on yet another bus
			and the transfer was so the other bus driver could see they already
			paid for their ride . Soon the bus jolted to another stop an older
			lady stepped onto the bus and flashed a card at the bus driver and
			took a seat at the front of the bus that was saved for elderly and
			handicapped people . Hannah tugged at her moms sleeve and whispered
			the lady did not pay . Her mother quietly told her she had a bus pass
			that she paid for a whole months worth of rides for a bigger fee than
			just one ride . That people who use the bus daily buy them to save
			money . Hannah thought to herself she would like bus passes for her
			and mommy . She enjoyed the bumpy ride with the jolting stops and
			wide turns that made her have to hold on tight . Hannah also noticed
			people pulling a cord and she figured out why . It made the bus
			driver stop where ever they would like to get off . Oh how she wanted
			to pull the string but , mommy told her no . It was only for when you
			needed it . Soon the bus stopped at the busy bus station . They
			stepped off the bus and got on a new bus . Her mom handed the bus
			driver their transfers . Hannah was excited because this meant the
			next place they were going was the shopping center to buy her new
			shoes . Soon the bus took off and made stop after stop . They even
			picked up a man in a wheelchair . He drove his wheelchair right up a
			special ramp and into a spot on the bus where the driver buckled him
			and his wheelchair in . Soon Hannah 's mom told her she could pull
			the cord to make the bus stop . The cord was up high but with a
			little help from her mom she reached it . Ding ! The bus came to a
			stop shortly after and there was the shopping center right in front
			of them . Taking the bus was a fun form of transportation . Hannah
			waved to the driver as he pulled away to pick up and drop off even
			more people around the city .</text>

		<text>Last Saturday , I decided to visit a friend in the hospital . I
			own a car , but it 's been acting up lately , so I needed to take the
			bus . I set out from my apartment with a spring in my step , because
			it was an amazing day . I walked through my apartment complex 's
			parking lot to reach the bus stop , where I waited for the bus around
			5 minutes . When it came to a stop in front of me , I boarded and put
			a $ 1 bill and 2 quarters in the fare machine . I selected a seat
			near the entrance , because it has more space and fewer people .
			Riding the bus often gives me motion sickness , so I closed my eyes
			and tried to ignore the swaying motion as it rolled down the street .
			Behind me , two college students were eagerly discussing a class
			project . In the very back , a small child was loudly pretending to
			be a dinosaur . I was glad when I finally reached my destination . I
			pulled the cord signaling that I would need the bus to stop next to
			the hospital , and got up to exit out the bus 's side door . Fresh
			air never smelled so good !</text>
