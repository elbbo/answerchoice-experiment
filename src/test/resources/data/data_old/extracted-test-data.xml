    <text>This past weekend, my family made so much food that there was still plenty of it going into the week. Knowing this, we chose not to make any new food, because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend. All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top. The stove is a gas stove, which produces a flame that, in my opinion, cooks food much better than an electric stove. On Monday after getting home from work, rather than making a new meal, my mom took some of the food that we had saved from the weekend and put it into a pan, and put that pan on the stove. She turned the gas on until the burner ignited, and left the heat on until she felt that the food was warm enough. When she ate it, she swore it was as good as it was when it was freshly made.</text>

    <text>Just recently, the light in my hallway went out, and since my younger brother is afraid of sleeping in the dark, this became an unnecessary problem. In order to calm him down, my dad went to the nearest hardware store to buy a brand new light bulb. He needed to make sure that the light bulb was the right size, so he took the old, burned out light bulb with him to compare. After finding the right size bulb, he paid for it and brought it back home. He then grabbed a nearby chair so that he could stand on to reach the empty socket where the bulb would go. He had me turn off the light switch, which would make sure that he would not get electrocuted while putting the bulb on or burned when it turns on. After less than 5 minutes, he is finished screwing in the bulb. We flip the switch to see if it works, and it does. My brother was now relieved.</text>
