			go get the plates. Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa all get big plates,
			but Tom is still little, so he gets a small plastic plate. We set a
			plate on each placemat. Now we need a napkin for each place. Luckily,
			we still have some napkins left over from the birthday party last
			week, so we will use those. It doesn't matter that they say "Happy
			Birthday." We put a folded napkin to the left side of each plate. On

			need to be careful with the knives. Closer to the center of the table
			we put a glass by each plate. Tom gets a plastic glass, because he
			isn't ready for a real glass one yet. We are ready to eat!</text>

		<text>It was 2 days before my friend Marc's birthday. I had already
			bought his present, but it still needed to be wrapped. So, I went to
			Walgreen's, and purchased some wrapping paper. I then came back home
			and got the gift that I bought for Marc out. I set the gift down next
			to the wrapping paper. I then opened the wrapping paper, and pulled
			out enough paper to cover the entire gift. I used a pair of scissors
			to cut the paper at that length. I then put the paper on the floor,
			and placed the gift in the center of the paper. I then began to cover
			the gift with the paper, by folding each side of the paper until it
			was over the gift, then I would take another side and do the same,
			until all sides were covering the gift. I then used tape to keep all
			the folds neatly together. Marc's Gift was now wrapped.</text>

		<text>Friday night my friend Stacey called me and invited me to go
			bowling with her and her friends. I was excited and met them at the
			bowling alley about ten minutes from my home. When I got there I
			rented bowling shoes in my size and put them on over my socks than
			met with my friends. I bowled a few times not hitting any of the pins
			down. Than to my amazement I aimed for the center and made a strike!
			All the pins fell down. I was very excited. How could I recreate this
			again I wondered? Throughout the evening I kept aiming for the center
			and made a few more strikes. Bowling takes a lot of practice but
			above all it is fun. It was nice playing with my friends and we made
			a great evening out of it. Next time I think I will bring other
			people with me!</text>

		<text>Yesterday I went bowling with my friends. They told me that they
			would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm. At 2pm I started getting
			ready. By 2:30pm I was ready. I made sure to bring socks with me,
			since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley. I
			grabbed my car keys and got in my car. I drove to the bowling alley.
			I listened to a little bit of music on my way. Once I got to the
			bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside. Once I was
			inside, I walked over to my friends. I asked them how many games they
			wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games. I
			walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.
			The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50. I wanted two play
			two games with my friends so I paid $7.00. Next, I needed to buy
			shoes so that I could bowl. I needed special shoes to go bowling so
			that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl. I asked the
			cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a
			pair. Now I needed a bowling ball. But I didn't want a bowling ball
			that would be too heavy. So I chose one that was only five pounds.
			All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling. We all
			put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game. I
			was first. Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes,
			and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting. Then I took my
			bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back
			then I let go of the bowl. The bowling ball flew down the lane. Out
			of the ten pins I knocked down six. Since I didn't knock down all of
			the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's
			turn to bowl. I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.
			Since I knocked down all of the pins I got a spare! By the end of the
			game I had won the most points out of all of my friends! I won! I
			returned my bowling shoes and then we all left to go eat dinner!

		<text>I have never had to ride a public bus until 4 years ago when I
			had no other transportation and was forced to take a public bus
			anywhere I needed to go . The first thing I had to do was find a bus
			schedule and learn how to read the time and places to catch the bus
			and how to make any needed transfers . This was a little hard to do
			but once I figured it out it was OK as long as I always kept a
			schedule with me . I mostly took the bus to work and I only had to
			worry about catching one bus on the street I lived on and I did not
			have to sorry about any transfers . The bus ride cost me $ 1.25 and
			transfers where an additional 50 cents . Many people rode the bus and
			I meet several nice people on the bus . The bus drivers were always
			nice and I became friends with several of them . The bus only came
			once an hour and I had to make sure I did not miss it if I was going
			to work because then I would be late for work . The bus always made a
			stop at the main depot in order to pick up more people . There was
			usually about a 20 minute wait so the driver could have break in the
			late afternoon . I did not like having to take the bus but it served
			my purpose for a while and I was thankful to have the bus available .
