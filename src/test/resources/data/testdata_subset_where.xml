		<text>Early this morning I woke up to the sound of my newspaper
			landing on my driveway. I sat up and wrapped my pink robe around me.
			I slipped my feet into my slippers and looked at the clock. It was
			only 7:00 but it was time for me to get my newspaper and drink some
			coffee. I looked out the window and noticed it was raining quite a
			bit. I saw the newspaper at the end of my driveway, as far away as it
			could be. I grabbed my umbrella out of my coat closet and opened my
			front door enough to stick the umbrella through and open it outside.
			I stepped out the door and quickly covered my head with the umbrella.
			Then I ran to the end of my driveway, scooped up the newspaper in its
			plastic wrapping, and ran back to my front door. I closed my
			umbrella, took off my slippers, and dried off. Then, I unwrapped my
			newspaper and sat down to read it.</text>

			get the five placemats out of the side cabinet. After we set the
			placemats neatly at chair. After we set a placemat at each chair, we
			go get the plates. Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa all get big plates,
			but Tom is still little, so he gets a small plastic plate. We set a
			plate on each placemat. Now we need a napkin for each place. Luckily,
			we still have some napkins left over from the birthday party last
			week, so we will use those. It doesn't matter that they say "Happy
			Birthday." We put a folded napkin to the left side of each plate. On
			top of each napkin we put a fork. Except for Tom, he gets a small
			fork. On the right side of the plate we put a knife and spoon. We
			need to be careful with the knives. Closer to the center of the table
			we put a glass by each plate. Tom gets a plastic glass, because he
			isn't ready for a real glass one yet. We are ready to eat!</text>

	<instance id="40" scenario="making omelette">
		<text>My stomach woke me up this morning. It was rumbling so loud, at
			first I thought it was an earthquake! I jumped out of bed and ran to
			the kitchen. I knew that I was going to need something that would
			fill my empty stomach up, so I decided to make an omelette. I opened
			the fridge and grabbed a carton of eggs and some mixed vegetables I
			chopped up last night. Then I opened the cabinet to get a bowl to mix
			my eggs in. I scrambled the eggs up with a fork, and then got a pan
			to put on the stove to cook the eggs in. After I turned on the stove,
			I put some a little bit of oil in the pan so the eggs wouldn't stick.
			I hate when that happens, it always makes cleaning up after really
			hard! Then I poured the eggs from the bowl into the pan and waited
			for the eggs to start to firm up. I poked at them with a spatula,
			pushing parts from the edge of the pan that were kinda firm slowly
			towards the middle of the pan. The uncooked runny eggs slide over to
			where the firm eggs were and cook up really quick! When there was no
			more runny eggs left, I turned off the stove and spread my mixed
			veggies on one side of the omelette. Then I used my spatula to fold
			the omelette in half so that the mixed veggies were in between the
			sides of the omelette, kind of like a sandwich. I put my omelette on
			a plate and took it over to my table to sit down and eat. My stomach
			roared like a lion when I looked down at the omelette. I think it
			took me less than a minute to eat the whole thing!</text>

		<text>First we travel to the tennis court. Next we change into our

			Tennis involves hitting a ball with something called a "tennis
			racket". This racket allows you to swing and hit a ball over a net.
			The goal is to avoid hitting the net, and hit the ball so that it is
			difficult for your opponent to hit the ball back to you. However, if
			your opponent hits the ball, he must also make sure the ball doesn't
			touch the net. Both of you may hit the ball off the ground,
			reflecting it into the air yet you must avoid the net. If your
			opponent hits the next or makes the ball go out of bounds, then you
			score a point. The objective is to make your opponent hit the net as
			many times as you can.</text>

		<text>It was family movie night so my husband, myself and our three

			respective beds. We didn't bother to wake them up to brush their
			teeth ( I feel guilty whenever this happens. ) we covered them up
			made sure night lights were on and kissed them goodnight. Our son was
			still up so we took the opportunity to snuggle a bit longer before
			taking him to brush his teeth. After teeth were brushed we made sure
			the night light was on and that he was all set for the night. Hugged

		<text>'' `` Riding A Public Bus '' '' Hannah and her mommy had just
			moved to the city . Daddy took the car to work each day now and her
			and mommy decided they wanted to go to the shopping center . Hannah
			was excited because today was her first time taking the public bus .
			Hannah and her family had moved to Portland , Maine and the bus they
			were taking was called the Metro . Hannah took her mom 's hand as
			they walked down the sunny streets of the city until they reached a
			sign that Hannah could not read but she did understand the picture .
			It was a picture of a bus . '' `` Does that sign say bus mommy ? ''
			'' Hannah asked . Her mother replied that it was and it was one of
			many many places around the city to get the bus to stop for them and
			others . They waited for a long while and finally a large public bus
			came down the street and stopped before them . They waited while a
			few passengers exited the bus because her mom said it was the polite
			thing to do and then they climbed the steps where her mother dropped
			their coins into the busses toll collector . Her mother then asked
			for a transfer and they walked quickly to their seats . Hannah asked
			her mom what a transfer was and she explained that because they were
			going way across the city they would need to get on yet another bus
			and the transfer was so the other bus driver could see they already
			paid for their ride . Soon the bus jolted to another stop an older
			lady stepped onto the bus and flashed a card at the bus driver and
			took a seat at the front of the bus that was saved for elderly and
			handicapped people . Hannah tugged at her moms sleeve and whispered
			the lady did not pay . Her mother quietly told her she had a bus pass
			that she paid for a whole months worth of rides for a bigger fee than
			just one ride . That people who use the bus daily buy them to save
			money . Hannah thought to herself she would like bus passes for her
			and mommy . She enjoyed the bumpy ride with the jolting stops and
			wide turns that made her have to hold on tight . Hannah also noticed
			people pulling a cord and she figured out why . It made the bus
			driver stop where ever they would like to get off . Oh how she wanted
			to pull the string but , mommy told her no . It was only for when you
			needed it . Soon the bus stopped at the busy bus station . They
			stepped off the bus and got on a new bus . Her mom handed the bus
			driver their transfers . Hannah was excited because this meant the
			next place they were going was the shopping center to buy her new
			shoes . Soon the bus took off and made stop after stop . They even
			picked up a man in a wheelchair . He drove his wheelchair right up a
			special ramp and into a spot on the bus where the driver buckled him
			and his wheelchair in . Soon Hannah 's mom told her she could pull
			the cord to make the bus stop . The cord was up high but with a
			little help from her mom she reached it . Ding ! The bus came to a
			stop shortly after and there was the shopping center right in front
			of them . Taking the bus was a fun form of transportation . Hannah
			waved to the driver as he pulled away to pick up and drop off even
			more people around the city .</text>

		<text>I live near the city of Santa Cruz and often take the 17X bus to
			the nearby city of San Jose . It 's possible to get discount fares by
			paying for multiple rides in advance , but I usually pay cash , five
			dollars for one-way . I get to my small town 's transit center early
			on weekday mornings , because the bus fills up quickly , and most
			good seats are already taken by riders who started their trip in
			downtown Santa Cruz . We wait in line in civilized fashion . Some
			people need only show the driver their pass , some shove a
			five-dollar bill into the fare machine efficiently . But some fumble
			with small coins or ask other riders for change , which makes
			everyone in line restive . Once on , riders can choose seats grouped
			around small tables , seats facing forward , or seats facing sideways
			. Table seats are premium , since the bus has WiFi and many people
			bring laptops . Others prefer seats in the back where the roughnecks
			are , just like in high school . My little town is the last stop
			before highway 17 . The bus whips along amid the pine trees and the
			yellow-flowered acacia that blooms this time of year . It is pleasant
			not to have to keep your eyes on the road . Unspoken bus etiquette
			decrees that strangers do n't speak to each other , but of course
			some people know each other and chat . Many tap away on their
