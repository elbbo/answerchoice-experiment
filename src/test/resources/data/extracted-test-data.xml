  <instance id="0" scenario="getting the newspaper">
    <text>Early this morning I woke up to the sound of my newspaper landing on my driveway. I sat up and wrapped my pink robe around me. I slipped my feet into my slippers and looked at the clock. It was only 7:00 but it was time for me to get my newspaper and drink some coffee. I looked out the window and noticed it was raining quite a bit. I saw the newspaper at the end of my driveway, as far away as it could be. I grabbed my umbrella out of my coat closet and opened my front door enough to stick the umbrella through and open it outside. I stepped out the door and quickly covered my head with the umbrella. Then I ran to the end of my driveway, scooped up the newspaper in its plastic wrapping, and ran back to my front door. I closed my umbrella, took off my slippers, and dried off. Then, I unwrapped my newspaper and sat down to read it.</text>

  <instance id="1" scenario="setting the dining table">
    <text>First, we clear everything off the dining table that isn't related to dinner, such as crayons and papers and computers.  Then, we count how many people are going to come to dinner. Tonight, there is Mom, and Dad, and Grandma, and Grandpa, and Tom, and the Baby. So, we are having five people, and one person in the high chair. Then, we go get the five placemats out of the side cabinet. After we set the placemats neatly at chair. After we set a placemat at each chair, we go get the plates. Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa all get big plates, but Tom is still little, so he gets a small plastic plate. We set a plate on each placemat. Now we need a napkin for each place. Luckily, we still have some napkins left over from the birthday party last week, so we will use those. It doesn't matter that they say &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot; We put a folded napkin to the left side of each plate. On top of each napkin we put a fork. Except for Tom, he gets a small fork. On the right side of the plate we put a knife and spoon. We need to be careful with the knives. Closer to the center of the table we put a glass by each plate. Tom gets a plastic glass, because he isn't ready for a real glass one yet. We are ready to eat!</text>

  <instance id="2" scenario="visiting the beach">
    <text>We look out the window and discover it is a bright sunny day, which is perfect for going to the beach. We load up the car with all sorts of beach things: buckets, shovels, beach chairs, towels, and an umbrella. We also pack a lunch in the cooler. Everyone in the family puts on their swimsuits and sunscreen. We drive to the beach, and we all unload the car and walk to the beach. We set up on the beach, with our chairs and the umbrella. Mom reads her book in the chair and hangs out with the baby, while Dad takes the older kids swimming. They are very careful to not go in the water too deep. After a while, Mom goes swimming, and Dad builds sand castles with the kids. We eat lunch, and then we shower at the some of the showers near the parking lot. We load all the towels, and buckets, and shovels back into the car, and we drive home.</text>

  <instance id="3" scenario="taking a driving lesson">
    <text>Yesterday, I had my first driving lesson. My mother told me it was time for me to learn, so we both got into the car, and drove to a part of my neighborhood that was sort of empty. There were not a lot of people living in this section, so it was more of a big area for me to practice. We got to the area, and we both got out of the car and switched seats. It felt very cool finally being in front of a steering wheel. I released the emergency brake, and put the car in drive, and did what my mom told me to do. We mainly drove around in circles and practiced driving in straight lines and making turns. After a few minutes practicing my turns, I put the car in reverse and practiced backing up. I made sure to look behind me to see if there was anyone, just so I knew it was safe. It felt very cool to have finally driven a car, and my mom told me how good of a job I did.</text>

  <instance id="4" scenario="making soup">
    <text>Soup is my favorite thing to eat, no matter what time of year it is. Today, I decided I wanted to make some stuffed belle pepper soup. I made my grocery list and headed out to gather all of the ingredients I needed. I came home and got started right away, since I was excited. First, I chopped my onion and put it into the big pot with some olive oil. I stirred them frequently while they cooked. Next, I added some garlic into the pot. I then added some ground beef. I mixed it together and let it cook until it was browned. I then added a big carton of beef stock, some water, and a can of stewed tomatoes. I then chopped my bell peppers into small pieces and added them to the pot. I let the soup slowly boil until the peppers were soft. At the end, I threw in a handful of Italian bread crumbs and some Parmesan cheese for some flavor. I was so excited to serve up a bowl and eat it.</text>

  <instance id="5" scenario="getting the newspaper">
    <text>I'm standing in my kitchen looking out the window at the front lawn when I notice the mail truck pass by and toss the daily paper out onto my driveway. I make sure I'm dressed to go outside and proceed to exit out my front door to retrieve the paper. Making sure no cars are close by on the road, where the paper was close by, I walked down my driveway and bent over to pick it up. The paper was enclosed in a plastic sleeve, so I removed the sleeve and threw it away in the garbage on my way back inside. The paper had been rolled up, so I proceeded to unroll it and smooth out any wrinkles or creases. I unfolded the paper to its regular size, and began to look at the main title on the front page. I open the paper up and look at the different sections where stories are written.</text>
